# Searching @product@ Source in Liferay @ide@

In Liferay @ide@, you can search through @product@'s source code to aid in the
development of your Liferay project. Liferay provides great resources to help
with development (official documentation,
[docs.liferay.com](https://docs.liferay.com/),
[sample projects](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/sample-modules),
etc.), but sometimes, searching through Liferay's platform and real-world apps

[Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-workspace).
Liferay Workspace is able to provide this functionality by targeting a
